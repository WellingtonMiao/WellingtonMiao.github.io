## Project Overview

MagTex is a bidirectional, textile-based human–machine interface that integrates **sensing and haptic feedback into a single piece of fabric**. By embedding soft magnetoactive fibers into machine-knitted electromagnets, the same textile patch can both detect motion and deliver localized vibrotactile feedback on the body.

We demonstrate MagTex in three example applications:

- A **wireless smart sleeve** that works as a soft game controller  
- A **Braille display glove** that provides localized haptic feedback for non-visual communication  
- A **closed-loop smart knee brace** that senses running speed and provides real-time feedback through a haptic glove  

Overall, MagTex aims to make bidirectional interaction **soft, wearable, and scalable**, while preserving the comfort and breathability of everyday textiles.

## Motivation

Modern human–machine interfaces are moving away from rigid handheld devices toward **soft, body-conforming systems** that can both sense and respond to the wearer.

Textiles are a natural platform for this vision:

- They are breathable, flexible, and familiar as everyday clothing  
- Smart textiles can embed sensing and actuation directly into fabric structures  
- However, **most existing systems separate sensing and haptics** into different modules, which increases bulk and complicates integration.  

MagTex addresses this gap by **co-locating sensing and haptic actuation in one textile unit**, reducing extra hardware and enabling more compact, wearable interfaces.

## How MagTex Works

MagTex is built from two key components:

1. **Magnetoactive fiber**  
2. **Machine-knitted electromagnet**

Together, they support two physical effects that enable bidirectional interaction:

- **Galvanomagnetic effect (for haptics):**  
  Alternating current (AC) through the knitted electromagnet generates an alternating magnetic field, which drives the magnetoactive fiber into vibration, creating localized vibrotactile feedback.

- **Electromagnetic induction (for sensing):**  
  When the magnetoactive fiber moves relative to the knitted electromagnet (for example, when the user taps or bends the fabric), the changing magnetic flux induces a voltage in the coil, which is then amplified and used as a sensing signal.

### Magnetoactive Fiber

- The fiber is made by **extruding a silicone elastomer mixed with NdFeB magnetic microparticles** into a long, soft composite fiber.  
- After curing, the fiber is folded and magnetized along its axis using a pulsed magnetic field, creating a **programmable magnetic profile** along its length.  
- The resulting fibers are:
  - Highly stretchable (breaking strains above 400%)  
  - Mechanically soft (Young’s modulus on the order of 1–2 kPa)  
  - Available in different diameters to trade off sensing strength vs. softness for haptics.  

### Machine-Knitted Electromagnet

- The electromagnet is created using a **computerized flatbed knitting machine**, knitting magnet wire into a loop-over-loop structure.  
- We explore multiple knit structures (plain vs. interlock, single vs. double layer) and find that a **single-layer interlock structure** provides the strongest magnetic field for haptics.  
- The knit structure remains mechanically flexible and can be bent along different directions without plastic deformation, which is important for wearability.  

### Sensing & Haptic Electronics

- A custom **sensing circuit** amplifies microvolt-level EMF signals from the knitted electromagnet using a two-stage amplifier chain and level shifting so that the ESP32’s ADC can sample them in real time.  
- A **haptic driver** uses a constant-voltage/constant-current module and an H-bridge to generate 1 A AC through the knitted electromagnet, with frequency controlled by the microcontroller.  
- A **relay-based switch** toggles the textile between sensing mode and haptic mode at up to 100 Hz with about 10 ms latency.  
- All circuits are stacked on three small PCBs (power, sensing, haptics) and enclosed in a 3D-printed case for portability and robustness.

## Key Results

### Sensing Performance

We evaluate MagTex sensing using two motion types:

- **Tapping:** pressing the fiber vertically toward the textile  
- **Rolling:** sliding the fiber horizontally over the coils  

Findings:

- Higher motion frequency → larger induced voltage, consistent with Faraday’s law.  
- Stronger magnetized fibers (up to saturation) → larger EMF.  
- Sensing amplitude remains stable even when the textile is bent to different angles, showing robustness under deformation.  

### Haptic Performance

For haptics, we characterize how far the magnetoactive fiber moves under AC excitation:

- Fibers with higher magnetic strength achieve **larger vibration amplitudes**, up to a saturation point.  
- Deformation peaks around **25–30 Hz**, giving a practical frequency range for designing vibrotactile sensations.  

### Thermal & Wearability

- Under pulsed 1 A actuation (10 s on / 10 s off), the textile warms up but cools quickly; the electromagnet is not intended to be in direct skin contact, which helps maintain safety.  
- The knit structure remains flexible and returns to its shape after bending, supporting everyday wearable use.

## Example Applications

### 1. Wireless Smart Sleeve (Game Controller)

A MagTex patch on the forearm, combined with gesture recognition, allows users to control a video game through **arm motions and taps**, while receiving haptic feedback on the same textile.

### 2. Braille Display Glove

A glove with multiple MagTex units can render **Braille characters as localized vibrations**, enabling non-visual, on-skin text communication for visually impaired users.

### 3. Smart Knee Brace with Haptic Feedback

A MagTex-integrated knee brace senses running speed and gait patterns, and a haptic glove delivers real-time feedback, closing the loop between **sensing, interpretation, and feedback**.
