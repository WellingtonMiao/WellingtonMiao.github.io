## Projects

**Multifunctional Human–Machine Interface Enabled by Magnetoactive Textiles**  
Graduate Research · Advisor: Yiyue Luo · Oct 2024 – Current  
- Developed a bidirectional human–machine interface platform integrating sensing and haptic feedback in a unified wearable structure by embedding soft magnetoactive fibers into machine-knitted electromagnets  
- Demonstrated applications including a wireless smart sleeve for game control, a haptic Braille glove, and a closed-loop knee brace–glove system for running-speed monitoring and feedback  

**Next Generation Asset Tracking System**  
ENGINE Capstone Project · Advised by University of Washington Medical Center · Jan 2025 – Jun 2025  
- Built an asset-tracking system using custom hardware, low-power embedded firmware, and a web dashboard for real-time location tracking, battery monitoring, and remote recalls  
- Leveraged Wi-Fi-based positioning, pressure sensing for floor-level estimation, and a latching LED circuit for visual alerts  
- <span style="color:#FFA500;">**First Prize, ENGINE Capstone Program 2025 (Top 2 among 59 projects)**</span>

**HaptiDrum**  
Advanced Embedded System Capstone Project · Instructor: Shwetak Patel · Mar 2025 – Jun 2025  
- Developed a wearable air-drumming system with high-frequency motion tracking and advanced haptics  
- Implemented precisely controlled electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) with hardware-level safety mechanisms to simulate realistic drumming sensations  

**Miniaturized Rotational Probe for Magnetic Field Mapping**  
Undergraduate Thesis · Advisor: Ka-Meng LEI · Aug 2023 – May 2024  
- Developed a 25 mm² PCB-patterned microcoil assembly motor-rotated inside an NMR magnet bore to map spatial magnetic field distribution via induced EMF measurements  
- Reduced temperature sensitivity; achieved agreement with traditional methods within 0.5%  
- <span style="color:#FFA500;">**Dean’s Honor List for Undergraduate Thesis**</span>
