**Multifunctional Human–Machine Interface Enabled by Magnetoactive Textiles**  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:baseline; gap:1rem;">
  <div>Graduate Research · Advisor: Yiyue Luo</div>
  <div style="white-space:nowrap;">Oct 2024 – Current</div>
</div>

- Developed a bidirectional human–machine interface platform integrating sensing and haptic feedback in a unified wearable structure by embedding soft magnetoactive fibers into machine-knitted electromagnets.  
- Demonstrated applications including a wireless smart sleeve for game control, a haptic Braille glove, and a closed-loop knee brace–glove system for running-speed monitoring and feedback.  



**Next Generation Asset Tracking System**  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:baseline; gap:1rem;">
  <div>ENGINE Capstone Project · Advised by University of Washington Medical Center</div>
  <div style="white-space:nowrap;">Jan 2025 – Jun 2025</div>
</div>

- Built an asset-tracking system using custom hardware, low-power embedded firmware, and a web dashboard for real-time location tracking, battery monitoring, and remote recalls.  
- Leveraged Wi-Fi-based positioning, pressure sensing for floor-level estimation, and a latching LED circuit for visual alerts.

**HaptiDrum**  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:baseline; gap:1rem;">
  <div>Advanced Embedded System Capstone Project · Instructor: Shwetak Patel</div>
  <div style="white-space:nowrap;">Mar 2025 – Jun 2025</div>
</div>

- Developed a wearable air-drumming system with high-frequency motion tracking and advanced haptics.  
- Implemented precisely controlled electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) with hardware-level safety mechanisms to simulate realistic drumming sensations.  



**Miniaturized Rotational Probe for Magnetic Field Mapping**  
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between; align-items:baseline; gap:1rem;">
  <div>Undergraduate Thesis · Advisor: Ka-Meng LEI</div>
  <div style="white-space:nowrap;">Aug 2023 – May 2024</div>
</div>

- Developed a 25 mm² PCB-patterned microcoil assembly motor-rotated inside an NMR magnet bore to map spatial magnetic field distribution via induced EMF measurements.  
- Reduced temperature sensitivity; achieved agreement with traditional methods within 0.5%.
