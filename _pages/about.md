**Yuxuan Miao** is a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, working in the <a href="https://yyueluo.com/group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wearable Intelligence Lab</a> advised by <a href="https://yyueluo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Yiyue Luo</a>. 

His research lies at the intersection of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI), Wearable Systems, and Ubiquitous Computing. He builds full-stack interactive devices for multimodal sensing, haptics, and tactile interaction, and more broadly explores intelligent, compact, and expressive interfaces that push the boundaries of HCI.

He is seeking Ph.D. admission starting in Autumn 2026.
