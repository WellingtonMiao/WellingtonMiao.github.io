**Yuxuan Miao** is a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, working in the <a href="https://yyueluo.com/group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wearable Intelligence Lab</a> advised by <u><b>Prof. Yiyue Luo</b></u>, and <a href="https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubicomp Lab</a> advised by <u><b>Prof. Shwetak Patel</b></u> and <u><b>PhD student Jerry Cao</b></u>.

His research interests lie in wearable sensor design, haptics, and fabrication for human–computer interfaces. He has experience with various sensing and haptic mechanisms, including tactile sensing for humans and robots, electromagnetic sensing and haptics, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS).

He is enthusiastic about developing hardware-integrated interfaces that can seamlessly blend into everyday life and interact with users in natural, unobtrusive ways. His long-term goal is to turn textiles, wearables, and ordinary objects into reliable input and output channels that support rich sensing and haptic feedback without increasing the user’s cognitive or physical burden.

Outside of research, he enjoys playing soccer, traveling, and trying new foods.

He is seeking PhD admission starting in Fall 2026.
